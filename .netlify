# Netlify Auto-Deploy Disabled
# 
# This repository is now configured for Docker-based deployment
# instead of Netlify serverless functions.
# 
# Netlify auto-deploy has been disabled to prevent deployment conflicts
# and failed deploy notifications.
#
# For production deployment, use Docker:
#   docker-compose up -d
#
# For development:
#   python enhanced_api_integration.py
#   # or
#   docker-compose --profile dev up
#
# Created: 2024-09-02
# Reason: Migrated from Netlify Edge Functions to Docker containerization
