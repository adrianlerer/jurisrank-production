# 🏛️ JurisRank P7: AI Limitations Research Implementation Roadmap

## 📋 Executive Summary

Based on the academic research analysis of AI limitations in legal practice, this document provides a comprehensive technical implementation roadmap to enhance JurisRank P7's constitutional analysis capabilities, addressing identified weaknesses in current LLM approaches to legal reasoning.

### 🎯 Primary Research Findings Applied to JurisRank P7

**Key AI Limitations Identified:**
1. **Context Window Degradation** - "Lost-in-middle" phenomenon in long legal documents
2. **Constitutional Hallucinations** - LLMs generating non-existent precedents or misquoting cases
3. **Prompt Sensitivity** - Inconsistent results based on question framing
4. **Lack of Transparency** - Black-box reasoning without citation verification
5. **Precedent Analysis Failures** - Inability to properly weight conflicting authorities

**JurisRank P7 Competitive Advantage Opportunities:**
- **Knowledge Graph Integration** for constitutional analysis
- **RAG with Verification and Traceability** for precedent validation
- **Multi-Model Ensemble Validation** for constitutional interpretation
- **Human-in-the-Loop Quality Assurance** workflows
- **Evolutionary Legal Intelligence** that learns from constitutional patterns
